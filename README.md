EXERCISE 1

1. Import the os module

2. Read the user's information that can be interpreted as a number, e.g. ask for an acceptable purchase price for the next course on Udemy. Remember the result in the line variable

3. Read the path to the file from the user

4. Without any additional control, save the line to a file with the specified path

5. Test the script by specifying the path to a file that can be created (e.g., the path to a non-existent file in an existing directory) and a path that cannot be created (for example, the path to a non-existent file in a non-existent directory). Notice what error is displayed in the second case
